## Prerequisites

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. Prior experience with basic webserver configuration and networking will be helpful but is not required.

>  
> ```bash
> docker: Error response from daemon: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit.

## Port configuration for external connectivity

In this step weâ€™ll start a new NGINX container and map port 8080 on the Docker host to port 80 inside of the container. This means that traffic that hits the Docker host on port 8080 will be passed on to port 80 inside the container.

```
docker run -itd --name nginx1 -p 8080:80 nginx
```{{exec}}

Now we have our container running on port 8080, go to [Nginx Webserver]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8080}}) to verify the result.

We can use multiple port numbers of the local machine to export our container ports, but there must not be more than one container or service using a port. Notice the error running the next command:

```
docker run -itd --name nginx2 -p 8080:80 nginx
```{{exec}}

Docker daemon response it is unable to bind the specified port. Nevertheless, we can use any other port that is not in use

```
docker run -itd --name nginx3 -v /myapp:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 9090:80 nginx
```{{exec}}

Go to [Nginx Webserver]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_9090}}) to check the result, there should be a "forbidden" message, but why?

Note we have mapped a folder on the local machine to the nginx2 container, pointing the /usr/share/nginx/html directory. This folder is where nginx looks for the html resources to expose, you can check in more detail Nginx configuration in its [docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).

Since we haven't added any html to the folder we defined, Nginx returns a "forbidden" results to the user. Let's add a basic html page.

Go to the folder we have previously mapped to the container and add a basic html text on the index.html file.

```
cd /myapp
```{{exec}}

```
echo '<html>
<header><title></title></header>
<body>
<h1>Hello Everyone!!!</h1>
</body>
</html>' > index.html
```{{exec}}

You should now be able to see your "__Hello Everyone!!!__" message exposed in the [Nginx Webserver]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_9090}})
